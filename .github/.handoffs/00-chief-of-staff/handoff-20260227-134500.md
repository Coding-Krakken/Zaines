## Executive Product Opinion (Concrete)
The current live site (`https://zaines.vercel.app/`) is visually polished but **not aligned to the business-owner profile** and **not conversion-safe** for the primary objective (BOOK NOW). It presents a broad “pet resort/daycare/grooming/training” business model with high-volume claims, while the canonical brand is a **small, elite, home-based, 3-suite private boarding service**.

Most pages render (`200`) and navigation is reachable, but critical trust flows are partially or fully broken:
- Booking appears blocked at step 1 due to failed availability checks and disabled progression.
- Authentication (“Send Magic Link”) returns a configuration error.
- Contact and review submissions appear to have no backend write action (no POST to site APIs after submit interactions).
- Repeated runtime fetch/session noise is present.
- SEO essentials (`/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt`) return `404`.

This is a **high-priority product correction**: fix core trust/booking reliability first, then enforce full brand/IA/copy realignment.

## Live Validation Evidence (Observed)
### Route Coverage
Validated accessible page routes (HTTP `200`):
`/`, `/about`, `/book`, `/contact`, `/faq`, `/gallery`, `/policies`, `/pricing`, `/privacy`, `/reviews`, `/services/boarding`, `/services/daycare`, `/services/grooming`, `/services/training`, `/suites`, `/terms`

### Defects / Non-Working / Incomplete
1. **Booking progression blocked**
   - On `/book`, state shows “Checking availability…” and “Continue to Suite Selection” remains disabled.
   - Console error observed: `Error during availability check: TypeError: Failed to fetch`.

2. **Auth flow misconfigured**
   - On `/auth/signin`, after entering `davidtraversmailbox@gmail.com` and clicking **Send Magic Link**, page shows `Configuration` alert.

3. **Contact submission likely non-functional**
   - Filled and submitted contact form with valid email.
   - No visible success state and no non-GET request to app domain captured during submit window.

4. **Review submission likely non-persistent**
   - Filled and submitted review form.
   - No non-GET request to app domain captured during submit window.

5. **Runtime trust noise**
   - Repeated Auth/session fetch errors observed in console logs during route activity.

6. **Accessibility warning**
   - Warning observed: missing `Description`/`aria-describedby` for dialog content.

7. **SEO completeness gap**
   - `/sitemap.xml` -> `404`
   - `/robots.txt` -> `404`

8. **Brand/positioning mismatch (systemic)**
   - Messaging emphasizes broad “pet resort” with daycare/grooming/training as co-equal offerings, luxury/high-volume social proof, and broad staffing claims.
   - Canonical profile requires “small, elite, home-based private boarding, only 3 suites, safety/comfort over volume.”

---

## Scope Boundary (Product)
### In Scope (Now)
- Booking path reliability and completion
- Authentication reliability for booking/account management
- Contact/review submission integrity and confirmation UX
- Brand and copy alignment to canonical profile
- Pricing clarity and trust-policy consistency
- SEO minimum viability (`sitemap`, `robots`, metadata consistency)

### Out of Scope (This Slice)
- New service lines or new pages beyond required IA
- Visual redesign experiments not tied to profile alignment
- Novel feature ideation not linked to conversion/trust/safety

## Prioritized User Stories + Acceptance Criteria

## P0 — Must Fix Before Growth Traffic

### Story P0-1: Booking Funnel Must Complete
**As a** dog parent ready to reserve a stay, **I want** the booking flow to proceed from dates through confirmation, **so that** I can actually book online.
**Tags:** `BOOKING`, `TRUST`, `SAFETY`

#### Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)
1. **Happy path progression**
   - Given I select valid check-in/check-out dates and service,
   - When availability check completes,
   - Then the “Continue to Suite Selection” action becomes enabled within 2 seconds.
2. **Availability failure handling**
   - Given availability service is unavailable,
   - When I attempt to proceed,
   - Then I see a clear recoverable message (not technical stack text) and a retry action.
3. **Edge case: invalid date range**
   - Given check-out is before or equal to check-in,
   - When I attempt to continue,
   - Then I receive inline validation and cannot proceed.
4. **Performance expectation**
   - Given valid booking inputs,
   - When I trigger availability,
   - Then the result returns or fails gracefully in <= 2s p95 on production conditions.

### Story P0-2: Auth Sign-In Must Be Configured and Usable

**Tags:** `TRUST`, `BOOKING`

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Given I submit a valid email on sign-in,
   When I click “Send Magic Link”,
   Then I receive a non-error confirmation state.
2. Given auth provider is misconfigured,
   When I attempt sign-in,
   Then I see a user-readable support path and the error is logged server-side with actionable code.
3. Given I submit an invalid email format,
   When I click submit,
   Then inline validation prevents request dispatch.
4. Performance: sign-in request response state appears in <= 2s p95.

### Story P0-3: Contact Form Must Persist and Confirm
**As a** prospective customer, **I want** contact submissions to be saved and acknowledged, **so that** I trust my inquiry was received.
**Tags:** `TRUST`, `BOOKING`

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Given all required fields are valid,
   When I submit contact form,
   Then a backend request is made and succeeds with visible confirmation.
2. Given backend failure,
   When submit fails,
   Then a retry-safe error state appears and form values are preserved.
3. Given spam-like repeated submits,
   When attempts exceed threshold,
   Then user gets anti-abuse response without data loss.
4. Performance: submit roundtrip <= 2s p95.

### Story P0-4: Reviews Submission Must Reflect True Moderation Workflow
**As a** customer sharing feedback, **I want** review submissions to actually persist for moderation, **so that** the social proof is trustworthy.
**Tags:** `TRUST`, `BRAND`

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Given valid review input,
   When I submit,
   Then a backend write occurs and I see “submitted for moderation” confirmation.
2. Given invalid input,
   When I submit,
   Then field-level validation appears and no write occurs.
3. Given moderation is pending,
   When I revisit,
   Then unpublished review is not publicly listed until approved.

## P1 — Brand and Conversion Alignment

### Story P1-1: Reposition Site to Canonical Business Model
**As a** safety-first dog parent, **I want** messaging that reflects a small private home-based boarding model, **so that** I can quickly trust fit and value.
**Tags:** `BRAND`, `TRUST`, `BOOKING`

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Given I land on Home,
   When page loads,
   Then hero communicates: private boarding in Syracuse, “Safe. Fun. Loved.” and direct path to booking.
2. Given I scan trust section,
   When reading benefits,
   Then I see profile-specific proofs: 3 suites, same-family dogs together, owner onsite, camera-monitored safety, no harsh chemicals, clear all-inclusive pricing.
3. Given I review service hierarchy,
   When navigating top-level IA,
   Then required pages are present and prioritized: Home, About Us, Pricing, Book Now, Contact.
4. Edge case: if testimonials are placeholders,
   When shown,
   Then copy clearly labels “coming soon” without fabricated counts.

### Story P1-2: Pricing Must Be Explicit and Decision-Ready
**As a** buyer evaluating cost, **I want** transparent pricing before confirmation, **so that** I can proceed without fear of hidden fees.
**Tags:** `PRICING`, `TRUST`, `BOOKING`

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Given pricing view,
   When reading rates,
   Then it clearly states selected pricing model (once owner decision is finalized) and tax treatment.
2. Given checkout pre-confirmation,
   When final amount is shown,
   Then no hidden fees/add-ons appear unexpectedly.
3. Given cancellation policy,
   When reading policy,
   Then terms are clear, concise, and consistent with booking funnel copy.
4. Edge case: undecided pricing model,
   When model is not approved,
   Then UI must display pending state internally only; public page shows approved customer-safe copy only.

### Story P1-3: Legal/Metadata Consistency and SEO Baseline
**As a** local customer finding services, **I want** clean metadata and crawlability, **so that** the business is discoverable and trustworthy.
**Tags:** `BRAND`, `TRUST`, `BOOKING`

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Given public site,
   When search engines crawl,
   Then `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` exist and return `200`.
2. Given page titles/meta,
   When inspected,
   Then naming is consistent with “Zaine’s Stay & Play” (no mixed legacy brand strings).
3. Given target keywords,
   When auditing SEO fields,
   Then Syracuse private/small dog boarding terms are represented across required pages.

## P2 — Experience Quality and Compliance Hardening

### Story P2-1: Accessibility Reliability in Dialog/Interactive UI
**As a** user of assistive tech, **I want** accessible dialogs and form semantics, **so that** I can complete key tasks independently.
**Tags:** `TRUST`, `SAFETY`

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Given any dialog opens,
   When screen reader inspects content,
   Then description linkage is present (`aria-describedby` or equivalent compliant pattern).
2. Given form errors,
   When validation fails,
   Then error messages are announced and associated to controls.
3. Performance: no accessibility-blocking console warnings in key flows.

## Dependency Map
- **P0-1 Booking** depends on availability service reliability + booking state management.
- **P0-2 Auth** depends on provider/env configuration and error state handling.
- **P0-3/P0-4 Forms** depend on backend endpoints/persistence + anti-abuse controls.
- **P1-1/P1-2** depend on business-owner approval for final pricing option and canonical messaging lock.
- **P1-3 SEO** depends on route metadata implementation and deployment verification.

## Recommended Execution Sequence for Chief of Staff
1. Route to `solution-architect` for architecture + contract correction plan (booking/auth/forms/seo first).
2. Route to `tech-lead` for vertical slice sequencing with P0-first release gate.
3. Route to `frontend-engineer` + `backend-engineer` for paired implementation of each P0 story.
4. Route to `qa-test-engineer` for acceptance trace tests mapped exactly to AC above.
5. Route to `quality-director` for final gate and PR readiness.

## Explicit Escalations Needed
1. **Business owner decision required:** finalize pricing option (`base_plus_tax` vs `tax_inclusive_flat`) before final copy lock.
2. **Stakeholder review required:** approve de-emphasis/removal of broad “pet resort” positioning in favor of canonical private-boarding model.
3. **Security/compliance check:** verify no sensitive data logging in booking/auth/contact pathways during P0 fixes.
