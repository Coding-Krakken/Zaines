## Original Request

continuously improve this website across all domains

## Classification

Type: Feature (Epic)
Priority: P2
Scope: Large (4+ agents)

## Acceptance Criteria (High Level)

- [ ] Define domain-by-domain improvement goals with measurable KPIs and thresholds.
- [ ] Produce prioritized backlog with impact, effort, risk, and owner.
- [ ] Define first tranche (3-5 items) with explicit acceptance criteria and quality evidence requirements.
- [ ] Ensure each tranche preserves model-first constraints and rollback safety.
- [ ] Prepare downstream handoff package for solution-architect.

## Your Task

1. Convert this epic into a concrete product improvement plan across these domains:
   - UX/Design
   - Accessibility
   - Performance/Core Web Vitals
   - SEO/Content discoverability
   - Conversion funnel
   - Reliability/operations
   - Security/privacy/compliance
   - Developer experience/release quality
2. Define measurable success criteria for each domain.
3. Prioritize and select top 3-5 near-term slices.
4. Draft child issue titles for each selected slice.
5. Hand off to `solution-architect` with model-first requirements and selected tranche.

## Constraints

- Follow strict model-first workflow; no implementation without required models.
- Preserve Square integration behavior (payments, POS sync, inventory, gift cards).
- Maintain rollback readiness and zero-downtime migration posture.
- Keep scope deterministic; avoid speculative abstractions.

## Next Agent

Hand off to: `solution-architect`
