## Original Request
Execute task from `.github/.handoffs/00-chief-of-staff/handoff-20260227-134500.md`.

## Context
Product-owner validated the live site and identified conversion-critical defects and business-model drift from canonical profile (`.github/.system-state/model/business_owner_profile.zaine.yaml`). P0 trust/booking corrections are required before growth traffic.

## Classification
- Type: Bug + Feature Correction
- Priority: P0 (with P1/P2 follow-ons)
- Scope: Large (multi-agent)

## Work Completed So Far
- Created issue body: `.github/issue-bodies/issue-20260227-p0-conversion-correction.md`
- Opened GitHub issue: https://github.com/Coding-Krakken/Zaines/issues/25
- Preserved traceability tags: `BRAND`, `TRUST`, `SAFETY`, `PRICING`, `BOOKING`

## Acceptance Criteria (Chief of Staff Routing Level)
- [ ] Architecture correction plan exists for P0 stories (booking/auth/contact/reviews) with API/data/error contracts.
- [ ] SEO baseline plan includes `robots.txt` + `sitemap.xml` + metadata consistency guardrails.
- [ ] Canonical brand/IA alignment plan maps directly to owner profile constraints.
- [ ] Security boundary checks defined for sensitive logging in booking/auth/contact flows.
- [ ] Execution-ready handoff to `tech-lead` includes dependency order and release gates.

## Your Task
Produce architecture + contract correction plan for the issue, with P0-first sequencing and measurable technical acceptance checks.

### Deliverables
1. P0 architecture correction brief (booking availability, auth, contact/review persistence, failure handling)
2. Contract inventory (request/response/error schemas) for impacted endpoints and UI flows
3. State/transition notes for booking progression and recoverable error states
4. SEO baseline technical plan (`robots`, `sitemap`, metadata consistency)
5. Brand/IA alignment mapping to canonical business profile constraints
6. Explicit handoff to `tech-lead` with ordered implementation slices

## Constraints
- Follow model-first governance in repository instructions
- No speculative features outside stated scope
- Optimize for conversion trust and booking completion
- Include escalation note for unresolved pricing decision (`base_plus_tax` vs `tax_inclusive_flat`)

## Next Agent
Hand off to: `tech-lead`
