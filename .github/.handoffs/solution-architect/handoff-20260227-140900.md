## Original Request
Execute the task in handoff file at `.github/.handoffs/00-chief-of-staff/handoff-20260227-134500.md`.

## Upstream Product Handoff
Source: `.github/.handoffs/00-chief-of-staff/handoff-20260227-134500.md`
Canonical profile source of truth: `.github/.system-state/model/business_owner_profile.zaine.yaml`

## Classification
Type: Bug + Feature Correction
Priority: P0
Scope: Large (multi-agent)
Risk Tier: T2 trust/conversion-critical

## High-Level Acceptance Criteria (Chief of Staff)
- [ ] Produce an architecture + contract correction plan that resolves P0 reliability defects first (booking/auth/forms).
- [ ] Ensure plan aligns with canonical business-owner profile and model-first workflow.
- [ ] Define concrete contracts/state handling for availability, auth magic-link, contact submit, review moderation submit.
- [ ] Include SEO baseline assets/contracts (`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`) and metadata consistency requirements.
- [ ] Map all corrections to traceability tags: `BRAND`, `TRUST`, `SAFETY`, `PRICING`, `BOOKING`.
- [ ] Provide sequencing and dependency plan suitable for `tech-lead` execution handoff.

## Detailed Product Acceptance Context
Use the full acceptance criteria in upstream handoff for stories P0-1..P2-1. Preserve wording intent and thresholds (including <=2s p95 expectations where specified).

## Constraints
- Model-first governance applies: update/define models/contracts before implementation directives.
- No speculative features, no IA expansion beyond canonical needs.
- Preserve PCI delegation constraints and avoid sensitive logging.
- Keep scope focused on trust/conversion safety and canonical brand alignment.

## Required Deliverables From You
1. `architecture correction brief` for P0 defects (booking/auth/contact/reviews/seo).
2. `contract/state delta list` (current vs required behavior) with guard/failure semantics.
3. `implementation-ready handoff` to `tech-lead` with phased vertical slices and gate criteria.
4. `risk register` for unresolved decisions (pricing option and stakeholder brand approval).

## Next Agent
Hand off to: `tech-lead`
