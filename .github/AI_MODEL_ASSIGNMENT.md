## Assignment Philosophy

Every agent is assigned a **primary model** optimized for its reasoning profile. The matrix maximizes quality-per-token by reserving expensive deep-reasoning for agents whose failure consequences are catastrophic, while routing structured execution tasks to fast, cost-efficient models.

| Principle                | Rule                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mini First**           | Default to GPT-5 Mini unless the task provably requires deep reasoning           |
| **Escalate on Evidence** | Upgrade to Claude Sonnet 4.5 only when triggers fire (not preemptively)          |
| **Downgrade Authority**  | Only Chief of Staff or Quality Director may downgrade an escalation              |
| **No Ping-Pong**         | An agent may escalate once per task; repeated escalation = Chief of Staff review |

## Escalation Triggers (GPT-5 Mini → Claude Sonnet 4.5)

Any GPT-5 Mini or Hybrid agent MUST escalate to Claude Sonnet 4.5 when:

| #   | Trigger                            | Detection                                                           |
| --- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| E1  | **3 failed attempts**              | Same task failed 3 times with different approaches                  |
| E2  | **Conflicting ADR decisions**      | Two or more ADRs contradict each other                              |
| E3  | **Security/privacy risk detected** | Any finding that could affect PCI, PII, or auth                     |
| E4  | **Unexpected test instability**    | Previously passing tests now flaky without code changes             |
| E5  | **Architectural uncertainty**      | Cannot determine correct component boundary or data flow            |
| E6  | **Ambiguous requirements**         | Requirements have multiple valid interpretations                    |
| E7  | **Cross-domain conflict**          | Optimization in one area degrades another (e.g., perf vs. security) |

### Escalation Format

```
⚡ MODEL ESCALATION: GPT-5 Mini → Claude Sonnet 4.5
Trigger: [E1-E7 code and description]
Agent: [agent-id]
Context: [what was attempted and why it failed]

```

## Fallback Triggers (Claude Sonnet 4.5 → GPT-5 Mini)

Claude Sonnet 4.5 agents SHOULD fallback to GPT-5 Mini when:

| #   | Trigger                         | Example                                           |
| --- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| F1  | **Repetitive mechanical task**  | Generating boilerplate from established pattern   |
| F2  | **Template population**         | Filling in ADR/runbook template with known values |
| F3  | **Simple documentation update** | Updating a version number or link                 |

### Fallback Format

```
⬇️ MODEL FALLBACK: Claude Sonnet 4.5 → GPT-5 Mini
Reason: [F1-F3 code and description]
Task: [specific mechanical task to delegate]
```

## Loop Prevention Rules

1. **One escalation per task per agent** — If Claude Sonnet 4.5 cannot resolve after escalation, route to Chief of Staff (not back to Mini)
2. **No self-downgrade** — An escalated agent cannot downgrade itself; only Chief of Staff or Quality Director can authorize downgrade
3. **Escalation ceiling** — If Chief of Staff escalation also fails, the task is flagged for human review
4. **Audit trail** — Every escalation/fallback must be logged in the dispatch chain

## Cost Impact Estimate

| Metric                                 | Value                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Agents on Mini (cheapest)              | 9 (33%)                                            |
| Agents on Hybrid (mostly Mini)         | 9 (33%)                                            |
| Agents on Sonnet (most expensive)      | 9 (33%)                                            |
| Estimated token savings vs. all-Sonnet | **~55-65%**                                        |
| Quality risk                           | **Minimal** — all high-stakes decisions use Sonnet |

The hybrid tier runs on Mini for ~80% of its tasks, escalating only on triggers. Effective Mini usage across the organization is approximately **55-60%**, with Sonnet reserved for the ~40% of work that genuinely requires deep reasoning.
