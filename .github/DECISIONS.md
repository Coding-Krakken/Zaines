## Decision Categories

- **Architecture** — System structure, component boundaries
- **Infrastructure** — Hosting, CI/CD, monitoring
- **State Management** — Client/server state approach
- **Styling** — CSS methodology, design tokens
- **Security** — Auth, encryption, compliance
- **Process** — Workflow, governance, methodology
- **Dependencies** — New library additions
- **Performance** — Optimization trade-offs

---

## Governance Rules

1. **Mandatory ADR triggers:**
   - New runtime dependency
   - New abstraction layer
   - Change to canonical pattern
   - Infrastructure change
   - Security boundary change
   - Performance trade-off

2. **ADR review requirements:**
   - Solution Architect approval for Architecture/Infrastructure
   - Security Engineer approval for Security
   - Tech Lead approval for Dependencies/Patterns
   - Quality Director veto authority on any ADR

3. **ADR lifecycle:**
   - Proposed → 72h review window
   - Accepted → Implementation allowed
   - Rejected → Document reasoning, close
   - Superseded → Link to replacement ADR
