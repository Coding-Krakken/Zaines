# Git & GitHub Project Management Workflow

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Status:** Active  
**Owner:** Chief of Staff (agent `00-chief-of-staff`)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document defines **strict git/GitHub project management workflows** for the 27-agent Copilot engineering organization. Every significant work item must be tracked in version control and GitHub project management systems.

**Core Principle:** Code not committed is code that doesn't exist.

---

## 📋 Workflow Overview

```
User Request
    ↓
Chief of Staff creates GitHub Issue
    ↓
Tech Lead creates feature branch
    ↓
Engineers implement & commit incrementally
    ↓
QA validates & commits test evidence
    ↓
Security reviews & commits audit report
    ↓
Quality Director creates PR (when all gates pass)
    ↓
PR merged → Close GitHub Issue
```

## 🌳 Branch Management

### Branch Naming Convention

```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>

Examples:
- feature/42-seo-foundation
- fix/123-cart-checkout-bug
- refactor/456-payment-handler
- docs/789-runbook-update
```

**Types:**

- `feature/` — New features or enhancements
- `fix/` — Bug fixes
- `refactor/` — Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- `docs/` — Documentation updates
- `chore/` — Maintenance tasks (dependency updates, etc.)
- `hotfix/` — Emergency production fixes

### Branch Authority

| Agent Role         | Can Create Branches | Can Merge to Main        |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Chief of Staff     | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes (emergency)       |
| Tech Lead          | ✅ Yes              | ⛔ No                    |
| Solution Architect | ✅ Yes              | ⛔ No                    |
| Frontend Engineer  | ⛔ No               | ⛔ No                    |
| Backend Engineer   | ⛔ No               | ⛔ No                    |
| Platform Engineer  | ⛔ No               | ⛔ No                    |
| QA Test Engineer   | ⛔ No               | ⛔ No                    |
| Security Engineer  | ⛔ No               | ⛔ No                    |
| Quality Director   | ✅ Yes (via PR)     | ✅ Yes (via PR approval) |

**Rule:** Only **Tech Lead** or **Solution Architect** creates feature branches for new work items.

---

## 💾 Commit Management

### When to Commit

**Commit Frequency:**

- After passing local quality gate (lint + typecheck)
- After every meaningful unit of work (≤3 files or 1 vertical slice)
- Before handing off to next agent
- When Quality Director approves (final commit before PR)

**DO NOT commit:**

- Failing tests
- Lint errors
- Type errors
- Secrets (.env files)
- Build artifacts (.next/, coverage/, node_modules/)

### Commit Authority by Agent

| **Backend Engineer**       | API routes + tests          | `src/app/api/`, `src/lib/square/`, `src/app/sitemap.ts`, `src/app/robots.ts` |
| **Platform Engineer**      | Infrastructure + deployment | `vercel.json`, CI/CD configs                                                 |
| **QA Test Engineer**       | Test files + evidence       | `src/**/__tests__/`, test reports, coverage                                  |
| **Security Engineer**      | Security audits + reports   | `.github/SECURITY.md`, audit reports                                         |

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns (DO NOT DO)

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Creating Work Artifacts Without Committing

**Bad:**

```
Agent creates 10 handoff files → dispatches chain → work complete → NO COMMITS
```

**Result:** Work exists only in local filesystem. Not tracked, not reviewable, not recoverable.

**Good:**

```
Agent creates work artifact → commits artifact → dispatches chain
```

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Committing Directly to Main Without PR

**Bad:**

```powershell
git checkout main
git commit -m "feat: new feature"
git push origin main  # Bypasses review!
```

**Result:** No peer review, no quality gates, no audit trail.

**Good:**

```powershell
git checkout -b feature/123-new-feature
git commit -m "feat: new feature"
git push origin feature/123-new-feature
gh pr create  # Creates PR for review
```

**Exception:** **Solution Architect** and **Chief of Staff** can push model-only commits to main for governance changes.

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Creating PRs Before Quality Gates Pass

**Bad:**

```
Tech Lead creates PR → failing tests → security not reviewed → merged anyway
```

**Result:** Broken code in production, security vulnerabilities.

**Good:**

```
All G1-G10 gates pass → Quality Director creates PR → reviews obtained → merge
```

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: Not Linking PRs to Issues

**Bad:**

```markdown
## PR Title

feat: add new feature

## Description

Adds a feature.
```

**Result:** No traceability, unclear why work was done.

**Good:**

```markdown
## PR Title

feat: SEO Foundation (E009)

## Description

Implements SEO invariants INV-SEO-1 through INV-SEO-5.

Closes #42
```

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 5: Batching Unrelated Changes in One Commit

**Bad:**

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "misc changes"
git push
```

**Result:** Impossible to review, impossible to rollback selectively.

**Good:**

```powershell
git add src/lib/seo/metadata.ts src/lib/seo/__tests__/metadata.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(seo): enforce INV-SEO-1 metadata constraints"

git add src/app/sitemap.ts src/app/__tests__/sitemap.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(seo): enforce INV-SEO-3 sitemap coverage"
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Agents creating work but not committing

**Symptoms:**

- Handoff files in `.github/.handoffs/` but git status shows untracked
- Work complete but no commit history
- Agents say "work complete" but no PR created

**Solution:**

1. Quality Director runs: `git status`
2. Reviews untracked files
3. Groups related files by slice
4. Commits each slice separately with proper messages
5. Creates PR after all commits pushed

---

### Problem: Merge conflicts in feature branch

**Symptoms:**

- `git push` fails with conflict error
- PR shows "Cannot merge due to conflicts"

**Solution:**

1. Tech Lead rebases feature branch:
   ```powershell
   git checkout feature/42-seo-foundation
   git pull origin main --rebase
   # Resolve conflicts in VS Code
   git add .
   git rebase --continue
   git push origin feature/42-seo-foundation --force-with-lease
   ```

---

### Problem: PR blocked by failing quality gate

**Symptoms:**

- Quality Director tries to create PR but G4 (tests) fails
- CI reports test failures

**Solution:**

1. Quality Director escalates to owning agent (Frontend/Backend Engineer)
2. Agent fixes failing tests

```

### Workflow Enforcement Policy (Automated)

The framework applies the following guardrails before and during implementation:

- **No work without work item:** If no issue is linked, block implementation (except tiny `hotfix/` branches that touch ≤2 files and are documented).
- **Review before coding:** Agent must review issue acceptance criteria and existing PR context before coding starts.
- **Branch-per-issue required:** Branch name must include issue number (`feature/<issue>-slug`, `bugfix/<issue>-slug`).
- **Commit checkpoint required:** Force commit when elapsed time or changed-file threshold is exceeded.
- **PR threshold required:** Open PR when branch divergence exceeds configured limits.
- **DoD gate required:** Tests, lint/typecheck, docs, PR quality notes, and acceptance criteria completion are mandatory.
- **Review gate required:** Self-review + independent reviewer + tester validation + security review (when relevant) before merge.

Reference implementation:

- `.github/framework/github-work-management.ts`
- `.github/framework/workflow-orchestrator-policy.ts`
- `.github/framework/definition-of-done-gate.ts`
- `.github/framework/workflow-telemetry.ts`
- `.github/scripts/github-workflow.ps1`
