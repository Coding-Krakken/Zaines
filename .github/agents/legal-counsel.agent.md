## AI Model Selection Policy

- **Primary Model:** GPT-5 Mini
- **Escalation Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **Tier:** 3 (Hybrid)
- **Reasoning Complexity:** MEDIUM

### Why Hybrid

License scanning and compliance checklists are structured. Novel IP questions, regulatory ambiguity, and contractual interpretation require deeper legal reasoning.

### Start with GPT-5 Mini For

- Scanning dependency licenses (MIT, Apache, ISC)
- Checking compliance against known license requirements
- Generating standard terms of service from templates
- Reviewing privacy policies against established checklist

### Escalate to Claude Sonnet 4.5 When

| Trigger                     | Example                                            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| E6 — Ambiguous requirements | Novel IP question or unclear license compatibility |
| E3 — Security/privacy risk  | Potential legal liability from data handling       |
| E1 — 3 failed attempts      | Compliance assessment repeatedly inconclusive      |

### Escalation Format

```
⚡ MODEL ESCALATION: GPT-5 Mini → Claude Sonnet 4.5
Trigger: [E-code]: [description]
Agent: legal-counsel
Context: [what was attempted]
Question: [specific legal/compliance question]
```

### Loop Prevention

One escalation per task. If Sonnet cannot resolve, route to Chief of Staff.
Only Chief of Staff or Quality Director may downgrade this escalation.
