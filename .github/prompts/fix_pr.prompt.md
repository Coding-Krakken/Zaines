**Instructions:**

1. **Resolve ALL Issues**
   - Fix **every error, warning, failing check, lint violation, build issue, runtime issue, test failure, and security concern**, regardless of severity level.
   - No exceptions or deferrals unless technically impossible — document any exception explicitly.

2. **Apply Optimal Engineering Solutions**
   - Implement the **most robust, maintainable, scalable, and production-grade solution** for each issue.
   - Avoid temporary fixes, suppressions, or workarounds unless explicitly justified.
   - Follow industry best practices aligned with Microsoft, Google, and enterprise engineering standards.

3. **Implement Copilot Suggestions**
   - Review **all Copilot suggestions, code review comments, automated recommendations, and inline hints** associated with this PR.
   - Implement them completely where appropriate.
   - If a suggestion is rejected, provide a documented technical justification.

4. **Complete Full PR Implementation**
   - Fully implement **all remaining unfinished work within the PR scope**.
   - Ensure all acceptance criteria, referenced issues, and intended functionality are completely delivered.

5. **Verification Requirements**
   - Ensure:
     - All tests pass.
     - Add or update tests as required to achieve near-complete coverage.
     - Builds succeed locally and in CI.
     - Static analysis and security scans pass.
     - Backend endpoints validated via automated requests (curl/API tests).
     - Frontend workflows verified via browser automation (desktop + mobile).

6. **Quality Hardening**

     - readability
     - maintainability
     - performance
     - accessibility
     - error handling
     - logging and observability
     - security posture.

7. **Documentation + Git Discipline**
   - Update documentation impacted by changes.
   - Ensure commit history remains structured and meaningful.
   - Update PR description to reflect all implemented work.
   - Close or link all related issues appropriately.

8. **Final State Requirement**
   - The codebase must compile cleanly.
   - Zero warnings.
   - Zero failing checks.
   - Zero unfinished TODOs within PR scope.

================================================================================
MANDATORY EXECUTION REPORTING — NTFY PHONE NOTIFICATION (URGENT + VIBRATE)
================================================================================

At the end of this task ALWAYS send exactly ONE ntfy notification to my phone.

Goals:

- Lock screen: ultra-short gist (1–3 lines).
- Expanded: full structured executive report.
- Include repo + git context and quick change stats when available.

Rules:

1. Always send ONE notification (even if nothing changed).
2. Keep the lock-screen section short and scannable.
3. Always include NEXT ACTIONS.
4. If you’re blocked, say why + what I should do next.

EXECUTE (copy/paste runnable):

REPO="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null | xargs basename || echo N/A)"

COMMIT="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo N/A)"

# Prefer staged/working-tree stats; fall back to last commit if clean

CHANGE_SUMMARY="$(git diff --shortstat 2>/dev/null)"
if [ -z "$CHANGE_SUMMARY" ]; then
CHANGE_SUMMARY="$(git show --stat --oneline --format= 2>/dev/null | head -n 1 | sed 's/^ //')"
