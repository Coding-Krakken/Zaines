# Prompt: Create Pull Request

**Category:** operations  
**Purpose:** Guide Quality Director to create production-ready pull requests  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Expected Duration:** 10-15 minutes

---

## Objective

Create a pull request (PR) after all quality gates pass, security review approved, and model compliance verified.

**Authority:** **ONLY Quality Director** can create PRs.

---

## Context

You are the Quality Director in a 27-agent engineering organization. Creating a PR is the final step before code reaches production. Your PR must:

- Include complete quality gate evidence (G1-G10)
- Reference the GitHub issue
- Include security sign-off
- Include complexity budget validation
- Request reviews from appropriate agents

---

## Prerequisites (All Required)

**Before creating a PR, verify:**

- [ ] ✅ **G1: Lint** — `npm run lint` passes with 0 errors
- [ ] ✅ **G2: Format** — `npm run format:check` passes
- [ ] ✅ **G3: Typecheck** — `npm run typecheck` passes with 0 errors
- [ ] ✅ **G4: Build** — `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] ✅ **G5: Tests** — `npm test -- --coverage` passes with ≥80% coverage
- [ ] ✅ **G6: Security Scan** — gitleaks clean (no secrets)
- [ ] ✅ **G7: Dependency Scan** — npm audit shows 0 critical CVEs
- [ ] ✅ **G8: Performance** — (pending deployment, mark as in-progress)
- [ ] ✅ **G9: Accessibility** — (if UI changes, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- [ ] ✅ **G10: Security Review** — Security Engineer approved

**If ANY gate fails:** DO NOT create PR. Escalate to owning agent for remediation.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Gather Evidence

Collect outputs from all quality gates:

```powershell
# G1: Lint
npm run lint > qa-evidence/lint-output.txt

# G2: Format
npm run format:check > qa-evidence/format-output.txt

# G3: Typecheck
npm run typecheck > qa-evidence/typecheck-output.txt

# G4: Build
npm run build > qa-evidence/build-output.txt

# G5: Tests
npm test -- --coverage > qa-evidence/test-output.txt

# G7: Dependency scan
npm audit --audit-level=high --json > qa-evidence/audit-output.json
```

---

### Step 2: Prepare PR Body

Use the PR template from `.github/PR_TEMPLATE.md` and fill in all sections:

**Required Sections:**

1. **Title** — Matches conventional commit format
2. **Description** — Summary of changes
3. **Related Issue** — `Closes #<issue-number>`
4. **Quality Gate Results** — All G1-G10 statuses
5. **Complexity** — Budget vs actual
6. **Files Changed** — List of modified files
7. **Test Evidence** — Test suite results, coverage
8. **Security Review** — Security sign-off
9. **Agent Sign-Offs** — All agent approvals
10. **Breaking Changes** — Yes/No + details
11. **Migration Required** — Yes/No + steps

---

### Step 3: Create PR via GitHub CLI

**Command:**

```powershell
gh pr create \
  --title "<type>: <description> (<epic-id>)" \
  --body-file .github/pr-bodies/pr-<issue-number>.md \
  --base main \
  --head <feature-branch> \
  --label "<labels>"
```

**Example:**

```powershell
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: SEO Foundation (E009)" \
  --body-file .github/pr-bodies/pr-42.md \
  --base main \
  --head feature/42-seo-foundation \
  --label "epic:e009,feature,ready-for-review"
```

---

### Step 4: Request Reviews

**Required Reviewers:**

- Chief of Staff (mandatory for final approval)
- Security Engineer (if security changes)
- Tech Lead (for technical review)

**Command:**

```powershell
gh pr edit <pr-number> --add-reviewer "00-chief-of-staff,security-engineer,tech-lead"

# Example:
gh pr edit 123 --add-reviewer "00-chief-of-staff,security-engineer,tech-lead"
```

---

### Step 5: Update GitHub Issue

Link the PR to the issue:

```powershell
gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "Pull Request created: #<pr-number>

All quality gates passed. Ready for review.

Reviewers: @00-chief-of-staff @security-engineer @tech-lead"

# Example:
gh issue comment 42 --body "Pull Request created: #123

All quality gates passed. Ready for review.

Reviewers: @00-chief-of-staff @security-engineer @tech-lead"
```

---

### Step 6: Monitor PR Status

Verify CI/CD pipeline runs successfully:

```powershell
# View PR checks
gh pr checks <pr-number>

# View PR status
gh pr view <pr-number>
```

**If CI fails:** Close PR, escalate to Tech Lead for remediation.

- Rollout duration: 72 hours

## Rollback Plan

**Trigger Conditions:**

- Error rate >1%

## Agent Sign-Offs

- [x] **Solution Architect** — Model compliance verified

## Breaking Changes

**None**

## Migration Required

**None**

No database migrations or environment variable changes required.

## Notes

- Sitemap intentionally emits baseline telemetry log under test conditions (expected behavior)
