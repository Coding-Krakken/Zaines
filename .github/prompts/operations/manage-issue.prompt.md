# Prompt: Manage GitHub Issues

**Category:** operations  
**Purpose:** Guide agents to create and update GitHub issues for work tracking  
**Complexity:** Simple  
**Expected Duration:** 5-10 minutes

---

## Objective

Create, update, and close GitHub issues to track all work items (features, bugs, epics, technical debt).

**Authority:**

- **Chief of Staff** creates issues for all user requests
- **Program Manager** manages issue lifecycle
- **All agents** can comment/update issues they're assigned to

---

## Context

You are part of a 27-agent engineering organization. Every significant work item must be tracked in GitHub Issues with:

- Clear title and description
- Acceptance criteria
- Epic/Phase reference
- Complexity estimate
- Agent assignment
- Status tracking

---

## Creating Issues

### Step 1: Prepare Issue Body

Use the template from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`:

```markdown
## Issue Title

[Type] Brief description (≤60 chars)

## Description

What needs to be done and why.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Epic/Phase (if applicable)

Epic: <E00X Epic Name>  
Phase: <P# Phase Name>

## Complexity Estimate

Points: <number> (within phase budget)

## Assigned Agent

@<agent-id>

## Related Files

- `<file1>`
- `<file2>`

## References

- ADR-XXX: <Decision title>
- Related issue: #<number>
```

---

### Step 2: Create Issue via GitHub CLI

**Command:**

```powershell
gh issue create \
  --title "<title>" \
  --body-file .github/issue-bodies/issue-<name>.md \
  --label "<label1>,<label2>" \
  --assignee "<agent-id>"
```

**Example: Epic**

```powershell
gh issue create \
  --title "feat: SEO Foundation (E009)" \
  --body-file .github/issue-bodies/issue-e009.md \
  --label "epic,feature,agent:solution-architect" \
  --assignee "solution-architect"
```

**Example: Bug**

```powershell
gh issue create \
  --title "fix: cart duplicate items on double-click" \
  --body "User can add duplicate items by double-clicking \"Add to Cart\".\n\nExpected: Single item added.\nActual: Duplicate items added." \
  --label "bug,p0,agent:frontend-engineer" \
  --assignee "frontend-engineer"
```

**Example: Security**

```powershell
gh issue create \
  --title "security: XSS risk in JSON-LD serialization" \
  --body "Script-breakout possible if product names contain </script> tag.\n\nSeverity: HIGH\nCVE: None (internal finding)" \
  --label "security,p0,agent:security-engineer" \
  --assignee "security-engineer"
```

---

### Step 3: Capture Issue Number

After creation, GitHub CLI returns the issue number:

```
$ gh issue create ...
Created issue #42
https://github.com/Coding-Krakken/FunkyTown/issues/42
```

**Save this number** — all commits, branches, and PRs will reference it.

---

## Updating Issues

### Add Comments

```powershell
gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "<comment text>"

# Example: Agent provides status update
gh issue comment 42 --body "Model artifacts complete. ADR-007 created. Dispatching to tech-lead."
```

---

### Add Labels

```powershell
gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-label "<label>"

# Example: Mark in-progress
gh issue edit 42 --add-label "in-progress"

# Example: Mark blocked
gh issue edit 42 --add-label "blocked" --body "Blocked by upstream Square API issue."
```

---

### Update Assignee

```powershell
gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-assignee "<agent-id>"

# Example: Reassign to different agent
gh issue edit 42 --remove-assignee "solution-architect" --add-assignee "tech-lead"
```

---

### Change Title

```powershell
gh issue edit <issue-number> --title "<new title>"

# Example: Add epic reference
gh issue edit 42 --title "feat: SEO Foundation (E009)"
```

---

## Closing Issues

### Close via PR Merge (Automatic)

If PR body contains `Closes #<issue-number>`, issue auto-closes on PR merge.

**PR Body:**

```markdown
Closes #42
```

When PR #123 merges → Issue #42 automatically closes.

---

### Close Manually

```powershell
gh issue close <issue-number> --comment "<closure reason>"

# Example: Completed via PR
gh issue close 42 --comment "Completed via PR #123. All quality gates passed."

# Example: Won't fix
gh issue close 42 --comment "Closing as won't fix. Out of scope for current phase."

# Example: Duplicate
gh issue close 42 --comment "Duplicate of #40. Closing."
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

1. **Create issues for all user requests**
   - Even small requests get an issue for tracking

2. **Use descriptive titles**
   - Good: `fix: cart duplicate items on double-click`
   - Bad: `fix cart`

3. **Include acceptance criteria**
   - Makes "done" definition clear

4. **Link related issues/PRs**
   - `Related to #40`, `Closes #42`, `Blocked by #50`

5. **Update status regularly**
   - Comment when starting work, when blocked, when complete

6. **Reference issues in commits**
   - Every commit should mention issue number

---

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Don't create issues without acceptance criteria**
   - Makes it impossible to know when work is done

2. **Don't leave issues stale**
   - If no progress for 7 days, comment with status update

3. **Don't use vague labels**
   - Bad: `bug`, `in-progress`, `p2` (no context)
   - Good: `bug`, `in-progress`, `p2`, `agent:frontend-engineer`, `epic:e009`

4. **Don't close issues without explanation**
   - Always comment why closing (completed, duplicate, won't fix)

5. **Don't assign multiple agents**
   - One owner per issue (can collaborate but single owner)

---
