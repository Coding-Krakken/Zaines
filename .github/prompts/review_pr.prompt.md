# 0. Mandatory Pre-Review Branch/PR Sync (EXECUTE FIRST)

Before running any review checks, you MUST detect PR linkage + working tree state and resolve it using the following deterministic flow.

## Detection

- `HAS_CHANGES`: `git status --porcelain` is non-empty.
- `HAS_PR`: current branch is linked to a PR (for example via `gh pr view --json number --jq '.number'`).

## Required Branch State Matrix

### Case A — Branch is NOT connected to a PR + uncommitted changes exist

You MUST:

1. Stay on the current branch.
2. Stage all changes (`git add -A`).
3. Commit all staged changes (single commit is acceptable; message should clearly indicate review prep).
4. Push branch to remote (`git push -u origin HEAD`).
5. Create a PR for the branch (`gh pr create`) targeting the default branch.
6. Ensure the branch is the checked-out branch for the remainder of the task.
7. Continue with the full review workflow below as normal.

### Case B — Branch IS connected to a PR + uncommitted changes exist

You MUST:

1. Stage all changes (`git add -A`).
2. Commit all staged changes.
3. Push updates to the same PR branch (`git push`).
4. Continue with the full review workflow below as normal.

### Case C — Branch IS connected to a PR + no uncommitted changes

You MUST:

1. Make no branch-content changes.
2. Continue with the full review workflow below as normal.

### Case D — Branch is NOT connected to a PR + no uncommitted changes

If no PR exists and there are no changes to commit, state that there is no active PR context to review and provide explicit next action(s) to create/select a PR.

## Enforcement Rules

- Do NOT skip this pre-review sync.
- Do NOT run review sections #1–#14 until the branch state matrix is resolved.
- Include in your final deliverables which case (A/B/C/D) was executed and what commands/actions were taken.

================================================================================
MANDATORY EXECUTION REPORTING — NTFY PHONE NOTIFICATION (URGENT + VIBRATE)

- Lock screen: ultra-short gist (1–3 lines).
- Expanded: full structured executive report.
- Include repo + git context and quick change stats when available.

Rules:

1. Always send ONE notification (even if nothing changed).
2. Keep the lock-screen section short and scannable.
3. Always include NEXT ACTIONS.
4. If you’re blocked, say why + what I should do next.

EXECUTE (copy/paste runnable):

REPO="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null | xargs basename || echo N/A)"
BRANCH="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo N/A)"
COMMIT="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo N/A)"

# Prefer staged/working-tree stats; fall back to last commit if clean

CHANGE_SUMMARY="$(git diff --shortstat 2>/dev/null)"
if [ -z "$CHANGE_SUMMARY" ]; then
CHANGE_SUMMARY="$(git show --stat --oneline --format= 2>/dev/null | head -n 1 | sed 's/^ //')"
